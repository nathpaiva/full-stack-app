# About this app

This is an SPA and API application in which the user can import a `CSV` file in the Front-end, and the SPA will render the data parsed.

The `CSV` should have this format, in which the first line is the header, and the following lines are each row. Some columns can have more than one value inside.

```csv
url,spam_score,matchin_target_indexs,matching_soucer_urls,domain_authority
globo1.com,1,"1,2,3","globo.com, 10",1
globo2.com,2,"4,5,6","globo.com, 11",2
globo1.com,3,"7,8,9",,3
globo2.com,4,,"globo.com, 13",4
```
